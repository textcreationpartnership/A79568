         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU expect my Sentiments of this Sermon, and the Author. I have fairly conſider'd the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Style, Arguments, and Deſign; have amended all the Printer's <hi>Errata,</hi> (that the Diſcourſe might appear with the beſt Advantage:) But found many more and worſe of his own, that require Correction. To deal in reality with my Friend, and all Mankind, I muſt ſay, it has very little or nothing of any Value, except its Brevity: And this, one would think, but a ſlender Reaſon to recommend it to the long-winded and long-ear'd <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> the only Perſons (I'm told) that give any tolerable Allowance of it. The <hi>Judges,</hi> and other Learned Men, ſaw no more Cauſe to thank him, than I do: And the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who came to liſten at the Doors and Windows, tho' extremely pleas'd with this Jingling Piece of <hi>Vulgar Oratory,</hi> are herein repreſented as Men of the ſmalleſt Reaſon and Judgment in the World, by making and continuing a <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Church,</hi> upon no material or ſubſtantial <hi>Ground;</hi> only for ſome fanciful, extraordinary, ſcrupulous <hi>NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THING.</hi> I have no Acquaintance with the Author, and therefore do not pretend to give a <hi>Character</hi> of him: But if we may believe ſome ſerious Perſons, he deſerves no very honourable Eſteem; tho' 'tis to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that he doth not <hi>live</hi> ſo looſely as he <hi>writes.</hi> But, perhaps the <hi>Saints</hi> may think his <hi>Sermon</hi> a ſufficient Proof, that he hath <hi>a Conſcience void of Offence both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and towards Man,</hi> ſince he inveighs ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly againſt the Vices of the Age: Yet for my part, I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135650:3"/> (who differ from them in much more weighty Matters) cannot agree with them in this. For, altho' heretofore an <hi>Exemplary Converſation,</hi> and a <hi>cloſe way</hi> of <hi>Arguing,</hi> were look'd on as <hi>neceſſary Qualifications</hi> in a <hi>Reformer;</hi> yet now-a-days no body is ſo forward to take that Office upon him, as he that wants <hi>Both.</hi> And that our Author is guilty, at the leaſt, of the <hi>latter</hi> of theſe, I think will be obvious to every one that peruſeth his Sermon with but a little more Care than it deſerves.</p>
            <p>And that this may not ſeem any great <hi>Wonderment</hi> to the impartial Reader, I ſhall deſire him to take notice of, 1. The <hi>Impropriety</hi> of the <hi>Subject.</hi> 2. His <hi>Illogical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</hi> And, 3. The <hi>Impertinence</hi> and <hi>Inſufficiency</hi> of his <hi>Arguments.</hi>

            <p>The Title is, <hi>REFORMATION and UNION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Preacher would have choſen a more ſuitable <hi>Text</hi> for an <hi>Aſſize-Sermon;</hi> or, at leaſt, would have made the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> to agree with the <hi>Senſe</hi> of his <hi>preſent Subject.</hi> I don't deny <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> to be very great and neceſſary Bleſſings; (none more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of them, none do more heartily endeavour after 'em, than true <hi>Church-men:</hi>) But he was a cunning Man, to ſpy <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> in this <hi>Text.</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have read <hi>God's Mercy</hi> and the <hi>Churches Duty</hi> judiciouſly recommended; and then, not directly, but by Inference or Application, our <hi>Gratitude</hi> to our moſt admirable <hi>Benefactor,</hi> our <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> might more fitly be enforc'd from the Words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> than <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Union.</hi>

            <p>He begins with a <hi>Grecian</hi> Deliverance; tells not <hi>How,</hi> nor <hi>What;</hi> but applies it to the <hi>Presbyterian Liberty. A Wonderment indeed!</hi> That this magnified <hi>Liberty,</hi> without <hi>Reſtriction</hi> or <hi>Limitation,</hi> (a <hi>Liberty</hi> that opens a Door to all <hi>Error, Hereſie,</hi> and <hi>Schiſm;</hi> to all <hi>Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Immorality,</hi> and <hi>Profaneneſs;</hi> to all the <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> and <hi>Diſorders</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi>) ſhould be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſo vaſt a Bleſſing in any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Government, or as a proper Means to preſerve <hi>Religion in the Life and Power of it! [Vid. Epiſt. Dedic.]</hi> This unbounded <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> (after all that can be ſaid in its Defence) is not a more juſtifiable Project to this purpoſe, than 'twould be to talk of ſecuring a <hi>Vineyard</hi> by pulling down the <hi>Fence,</hi> laying it wide open to the Mercy of <hi>Boars</hi> and <hi>Foxes;</hi> preſuming that this Liberty would <hi>civilize</hi> and <hi>ſoften</hi> their wild and ſavage Natures, render 'em ſo <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>inoffenſive,</hi> as not to root up or tear down the <hi>Vines;</hi> merely, becauſe theſe brutiſh Creatures were left to their <hi>own Liberty.</hi> Our Author was not aware of this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, or conceal'd all Apprehenſions of Danger, from our preſent Circumſtances: But in a <hi>Page</hi> or two, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to make ſweet Muſick in the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Ears, boldly touches again upon the ſame String, and joins himſelf in Conſort with them, <hi>pag.</hi> 1, 3. Their <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> were remembred, but not the <hi>Cauſe</hi> for which they ſuffer'd, nor that of his own <hi>Suſpenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the <hi>Grecians,</hi> he bethinks himſelf of the <hi>Jews,</hi> (to whom by his Text he ow'd a peculiar Reference) gives this Account of them, as of the former, <hi>That they were like Men in a Dream.</hi> Doubtleſs, the Preacher was <hi>ſo,</hi> when he deliver'd this <hi>Sermon;</hi> and not well <hi>awake</hi> when he printed it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>In the ſame <hi>Page</hi> we have his wiſe Obſervation, <hi>viz. That God is pleas'd to work in a very eminent manner for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135650:4"/> the Welfare of his People: And when he doth ſo, it's their Duty to take notice of it.</hi> I would not here be miſtaken, as if I blam'd him for aſſerting ſo evident Truths: That which I eſteem him culpable for, is the making of that to be but <hi>One Obſervation,</hi> which is ſo plainly <hi>Two.</hi> But perhaps this muſt paſs for a very excuſable Miſtake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily betray'd into it by his Love of <hi>Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. he tells us, <hi>That all the Deſires and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, by juſt and due Methods, to make us happy, were fruſtrated; and the Strugglings of Honeſt Men were but like thoſe of Slaves, which ended in a more cruel Bondage.</hi> This I muſt own to be a ſad Truth: But, as I take it, the Perſons that chiefly, if not ſolely, ſtood in the Gap, were <hi>Church-men. Fanaticks</hi> were favour'd with <hi>Smiles</hi> and <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> when the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> were thrown out of their <hi>lawful Poſſeſſions:</hi> And at the ſame time that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> many <hi>Sectaries</hi> were receiv'd in the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> and into the <hi>Boſom:</hi> So that what immediately follows, I ſhall aſſent to, tho' poſſibly with a different Aim and Meaning from him, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>tho' we had then to do with thoſe who went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>yet were our Lives and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties in the Hands of Violence and Oppreſſion.</hi> I diſown not our late <hi>Dangers</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery;</hi> nor would I undervalue the <hi>Mercy</hi> of a <hi>Deliverance:</hi> Yet if the <hi>Nation</hi> muſt be ruin'd or enſlav'd, why not by <hi>Popery,</hi> as well as <hi>Presbytery?</hi> If we are to ſuffer in <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Eſtate,</hi> it matters not what <hi>Religion</hi> our <hi>Executioners</hi> profeſs. If a Ship be in danger of Sinking, this <hi>Scylla,</hi> or that <hi>Charybdis,</hi> are equally Fatal, and equally to be avoided, by ſteering in the Middle and Safe Way of the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. he preſents us with a mighty <hi>Harangue</hi> in Praiſe of the <hi>KING;</hi> but perhaps not with over-much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135650:4"/> 
               <hi>Sincerity:</hi> For, that <hi>Party</hi> which he <hi>favours,</hi> and hopes <hi>to be favour'd by,</hi> have an <hi>Invincible Prejudice</hi> to <hi>Crown'd Heads,</hi> and will always follow the Bent of their own Inclinations, which will not ſuffer them to ſhew any real Kindneſs to <hi>Monarchy;</hi> and therefore, notwithſtanding their fulſom Flattery, <hi>They are not preſently to be truſted, for fear the Sting ſhould ſtill be in them, and Safety and Opportunity might Encourage them to thruſt it out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. None more likely to have that unworthy Carriage of the <hi>Refreſh'd Traveller,</hi> than <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> who kneel to the <hi>King</hi> as the <hi>Fountain of Refreſhment,</hi> yet may ſoon turn their Backs, when they don't need him. What Sort of Men ſo <hi>Fickle,</hi> or ſo <hi>Inconſtant?</hi> Or where can we find a more <hi>Ungrateful</hi> People? All the <hi>Kindneſſes,</hi> all the <hi>merciful Conceſſions</hi> ſhew'd them in former Reigns, were interpreted as Arguments of <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>Cowardice</hi> in the <hi>Prince;</hi> and the Conſequence of <hi>That,</hi> is too well known, to need a Remembrance. Only this one Thing I would not omit,<note place="margin">N.

            <p>I am not fond of expoſing all the Miſapplications of this <hi>Man of Uſes;</hi> nor of finding Fault with any Thing, wherein the <hi>Truth</hi> was not in danger to be miſtaken.

            <p>At length he comes to his <hi>REFORMATION and UNION,</hi> p. 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>To the Firſt, I anſwer, That if our <hi>Church</hi> needs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from her <hi>Dregs,</hi> with all our Hearts, we deſire it ſhould be ſo: But then, I doubt, (without <hi>gentle Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi>) Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will not long continue in our <hi>Communion,</hi> but muſt ſink down to the <hi>Common-ſhore,</hi> amongſt the worſt <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> Does he, or any Man believe, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have no Cauſe to purge out <hi>their Dregs</hi> too? I'm ſure their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> require it; 'tis as much wanting among the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and all other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and more by far, than in the <hi>Church.</hi> This <hi>Univerſal Reformation</hi> we daily pray for; and it would be ſooner done, all <hi>Immoralities</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs</hi> would <hi>ceaſe</hi> to a great Degree, were not the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135650:5"/> 
               <hi>proper Means</hi> of <hi>Reformation</hi> ſo ſtrenuouſly oppos'd by our <hi>open</hi> and <hi>ſecret Enemies. Theſe</hi> are chiefly in the Fault; We muſt expect to be more and more vitiated and deform'd, in our <hi>Manners,</hi> to ſee the <hi>Nation</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to all <hi>Miſchiefs;</hi> unleſs we can fanſie this to be the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> wherein Men will be <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Vertuous</hi> of <hi>themſelves,</hi> without the Force of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> to govern them. So <hi>deſirable a Bleſſing,</hi> I am certain, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belong to this <hi>evil, crooked, and perverſe Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not to be doubted, but there is too much <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> practiſed in the Land: But whether the <hi>Unjuſtifiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Sin, or our <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> againſt it, hath occaſion'd a Reformation in this Particular, I know not; but am willing to believe, That our <hi>Gentry</hi> are leſs guilty of it than formerly, and that it is now ſunk to the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom</hi> of the <hi>People;</hi> with whom, perhaps, this Gentleman moſtly converſeth; and therefore judgeth of the <hi>Age,</hi> by the <hi>Company</hi> that he himſelf keeps. But ſuppoſing that it reigned as much as ever, yet I don't like his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> for ſuppreſſing it; which is, <hi>That Pariſh-Officers ſhould be moſt ſtrictly requir'd to take notice of it.</hi> If he means, in ſtead of that Method which the <hi>Parliament</hi> has preſcrib'd, (wherein the <hi>Accuſer</hi> is ſo much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſo much threatned, if he be remiſs) then, I think, our Change would be much for the Worſe: But, if he means it as an <hi>additional Help</hi> to the <hi>Statute,</hi> I fancy, the <hi>Parliament</hi> will ſcarce think it worth their while to follow his Advice, and make a <hi>New Act,</hi> rather than loſe his <hi>Expedient;</hi> when every one that will, may put his helping Hand to the Suppreſſing of the <hi>Vice;</hi> which may be ſomewhat more uſeful, than an Injunction upon <hi>Pariſh-Officers</hi> is like to be.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:135650:6"/>
            <p>In the ſame <hi>Paragraph</hi> he commends a very few Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that <hi>County,</hi> for their <hi>Zeal</hi> in this Matter; and at the ſame Breath, caſts a <hi>Diſreſpect</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> upon all the reſt: And yet thoſe <hi>mighty Men of Morals,</hi> thoſe <hi>Church-Presbyterians,</hi> whom he deſign'd to complement, <hi>are too well known to be truſted,</hi> have <hi>Infirmities</hi> of this kind, and as <hi>many</hi> as their Neighbours. This <hi>forward, diſſembled Zeal,</hi> is not unlike that of a paſſionate <hi>School-maſter,</hi> about the Year 41, who would whip his <hi>Boys</hi> for <hi>Swearing,</hi> and at the ſame time often <hi>ſwear</hi> violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That he had rather ſpare 'em for any Vice than That.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Thing more I obſerve upon this Head, That among all the <hi>Vices</hi> of the <hi>Age,</hi> he durſt not ſo much as touch upon <hi>Schiſm, Pride, Malice,</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience (the daily Service offer'd to their God:)</hi> Sins that lie too plainly at the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Doors; Sins of as <hi>vile</hi> a <hi>Nature,</hi> and of as <hi>dangerous Conſequence,</hi> as any he had named: But he was careful to leave <hi>Theſe</hi> out, for fear of loſing his <hi>Deſign;</hi> and what <hi>That</hi> was, let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge: 'Tis plain, if he favours or excuſes the Practice of any Sin, <hi>in vain does he talk of a Thorow-Reformation;</hi> unleſs he means by <hi>This,</hi> as one did by the <hi>Thorow-paſſage</hi> of a <hi>Sermon,</hi> (i. e.) when <hi>it goes in at one Ear, and out at t' other.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135650:6"/> Life Eternal,</hi> or the <hi>Way</hi> to theſe; That our Conteſts are about Things of very ſmall moment, that may either <hi>be done,</hi> or <hi>omitted,</hi> without <hi>Sin:</hi> Which Side now, in Reaſon and Duty, ought to comply? Muſt the <hi>Mother</hi> quit all her juſt Authority over her <hi>ſtubborn, prodigal,</hi> and <hi>rebellious Children,</hi> and give them leave to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful?</hi> ſubmit to, and approve their <hi>Diſorders?</hi> How miſerable muſt be the State of ſuch an <hi>unnatural Family!</hi> And ſhall our <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> (this <hi>Apoſtolical, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, Well-eſtabliſh'd Church,</hi> careful to preſerve her <hi>Children</hi> in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>good Order</hi>) muſt She be rul'd by the <hi>Diſſenters?</hi> break all <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them that delight in <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and agree in <hi>nothing elſe?</hi> who, had they Power to govern in <hi>Church-Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> would not grant us <hi>Liberty</hi> to uſe our own <hi>Prayers;</hi> nor thoſe Innocent <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> which they once deſtroy'd? Ought not they rather to recede from their <hi>private Humour</hi> and <hi>Fancies,</hi> and gladly join in our <hi>Communion?</hi> Let any ſober, modeſt, impartial <hi>Conſiderer</hi> judge fairly between the <hi>Mother</hi> and her <hi>Children,</hi> (a moſt <hi>compaſſionate Mother,</hi> willing to forgive and forget <hi>Offences,</hi> and with both Hands to embrace all that are <hi>ſenſible</hi> of their <hi>Errors,</hi> and <hi>return</hi> to their <hi>due Obedience.</hi>) Shall thoſe Men that allow our <hi>Church</hi> to be in the Right, as to all <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Points</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> venture the Ruine of the <hi>whole Family,</hi> rather than comply in ſome Things, which many of 'em confeſs, are not worth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing?</p>
            <p>Or, if by <hi>Union,</hi> he means, a <hi>kind, charitable Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in <hi>yielding</hi> to each other in a few <hi>Indifferent Things;</hi> I would know, what <hi>one Step</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have made towards this <hi>Union?</hi> No Offer on our Part
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135650:7"/> will ſuffice, to this purpoſe, leſs than the <hi>Abolition</hi> of our <hi>whole Service, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> Theſe Men are by many undeniable <hi>Arguments</hi> (in <hi>Conferences</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi>) convinc'd, That our <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are <hi>good</hi> and <hi>lawful;</hi> They have declar'd ſo, by their <hi>Occaſional</hi> Communicating in our <hi>Churches,</hi> and getting their Sons admitted into our <hi>Society,</hi> as <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> (which, if <hi>ſinful,</hi> I hope they would not do.) I may add, That before the <hi>Toleration</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, few were the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in moſt <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> that came not frequently to <hi>Church,</hi> and united in our <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip:</hi> But now, in ſtead of <hi>uniting,</hi> they ſtrive to <hi>divide</hi> us, multiply their <hi>Schiſm-Houſes,</hi> and ſet up as many <hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Diviſion,</hi> as they have <hi>Gifted-Men,</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>delude</hi> and <hi>ſqueeze</hi> the unthinking People.</p>
            <p>However, I ſhall next examine his <hi>Five Arguments</hi> for <hi>Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt whereof is, <hi>Becauſe Infallibility is not lodg'd with any Men.</hi> Which <hi>Argument</hi> would do mighty well in the Hands of the moſt <hi>abominable Heretick:</hi> Suppoſe, for the preſent, a <hi>Socinian;</hi> May not he, by this way of Reaſoning, plead thus for himſelf, to the <hi>Orthodox?</hi> 
               <q>You ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is truly <hi>God,</hi> and for this Doctrine you pretend the Authority of Scripture; but there is no Paſſage that you quote, which we do not expound to a different Senſe from you, and think our ſelves in the right: And you know, you are but Men, and therefore may err, as well as we. Let us therefore have no more Words about the Matter, but leave it to the Laſt Day to clear all <hi>Doubts.</hi>
               </q> But, what if there be no <hi>Infallibility?</hi> Will he infer from thence, that there is no <hi>Certainty?</hi> I ſuppoſe, he is ſure, that he underſtands ſome <hi>plain Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture;</hi> and yet, I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135650:7"/> hope, he will not pretend to be <hi>Infallible.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that I know of, which can hinder a Man from believing <hi>ſome Accounts</hi> of what was done in <hi>former Times,</hi> tho' he do not eſteem the <hi>moſt Authentick Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> to be endued with an <hi>Infallible Spirit.</hi> And I think Matters of <hi>Religion</hi> are capable of as good <hi>Evidence,</hi> as Matters of <hi>Fact.</hi> So that, notwithſtanding it <hi>be true,</hi> That no Man is <hi>Infallible;</hi> yet ſtill, in a <hi>Controverted Point,</hi> one Side may be ſure, that their <hi>Adverſaries</hi> are in the wrong.</p>
            <p>But where <hi>Reaſon</hi> will not ſerve, <hi>Authority</hi> muſt help: And therefore we have the <hi>Opinion</hi> of Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> in the Caſe, whom he hath quoted fairly, but I think to little purpoſe, unleſs his <hi>Judgment</hi> were more <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>valuable,</hi> than really it is. And if I might be permitted to deliver my <hi>Thoughts,</hi> I ſhould ſay, That our <hi>Author</hi> hath done the <hi>Doctor</hi> much more Honour by quoting him, than the <hi>Doctor</hi> has done him by his <hi>Concurrence.</hi> But againſt <hi>his,</hi> I ſhall oppoſe the <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>London-Divines,</hi> who in their <hi>Learned Tracts</hi> concerning the <hi>Points</hi> in <hi>Controverſie,</hi> have ſaid enough to convince <hi>all People,</hi> except the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wake. Pag.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Second Argument</hi> for <hi>Union,</hi> is <hi>Mutual Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: All the Diſſenters now declare for it, as the beſt Expedient.</hi> To this I anſwer, We may and ought to have <hi>Charity</hi> for each other, even to our moſt impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable <hi>Enemies:</hi> But this alone cannot poſſibly unite ſuch a <hi>Medley</hi> of <hi>differing</hi> and <hi>contrary Religions</hi> into <hi>one Church.</hi> For, if we offer never ſo <hi>good</hi> and <hi>convincing Reaſons,</hi> every Man is left to his own <hi>Choice,</hi> to <hi>admit</hi> or <hi>refuſe</hi> them, as he thinks fit: So that if there wants <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> for the Encouragement of thoſe who do <hi>unite,</hi> and to diſcourage thoſe who <hi>refuſe</hi> their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135650:8"/> 
               <hi>Communion,</hi> they cannot long hold together. I heartily commend a <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>moderate Uſe</hi> of <hi>Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> and of thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> that are <hi>neceſſary</hi> for the <hi>well-governing</hi> of us all: But no Man can frame ſuch a <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> in which ſo many <hi>oppoſite Parties</hi> can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, if there is not ſomething more than <hi>Mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,</hi> to keep the <hi>Body</hi> in <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Motion. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould ſoften, but not deſtroy Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Third Argument.</hi> When the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have nothing elſe to ſay for their <hi>unreaſonable Diviſions,</hi> then they call themſelves <hi>Weak Brethren,</hi> and would be <hi>treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch.</hi> But, I marvel under what <hi>Pretence</hi> they can challenge any <hi>Privilege</hi> belonging to Them, under <hi>that Notion.</hi> They take upon them to be <hi>Teachers of others, wiſer</hi> and <hi>better</hi> than their Neighbours, the only <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Godly Party,</hi> and are apt to deſpiſe all other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> as <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Profane.</hi> With what <hi>Colour</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> then can it be pleaded for them, to have any <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> or <hi>Compliance</hi> ſhew'd to their <hi>Weakneſs?</hi> Tho' they love to argue againſt us from the Example of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> to the uninſtructed <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet it is apparent, that they do not in <hi>other Caſes</hi> willingly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken themſelves to thoſe <hi>Weak Believers,</hi> or <hi>Babes in Chriſt.</hi> They have really better Thoughts of <hi>themſelves,</hi> would be <hi>Leaders</hi> and <hi>Maſters in Iſrael,</hi> preſcribe to their <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> give <hi>Laws</hi> to <hi>all others;</hi> and do prefer their own <hi>private Opinion</hi> (which they call their <hi>Conſcience</hi>) before the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>wiſeſt Men,</hi> or the <hi>Determination</hi> of their <hi>lawful Superiours:</hi> And if, in all Inſtances, we ſhould deal with them as <hi>weak Perſons,</hi> adviſe them to learn their <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> they would think themſelves highly wrong'd and injur'd. If the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> did in good earneſt look upon themſelves as <hi>weak,</hi> that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135650:8"/> is, <hi>ignorant, wavering, half-Chriſtians;</hi> did they think the Diſlike of the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> to be the Effect of ſuch <hi>Weakneſs;</hi> they would either be more careful to <hi>hide</hi> it, or more diligently ſeek out for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy:</hi> They would be more <hi>modeſt</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> and not ſo forward to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> what they don't <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand:</hi> They would not encourage one another to <hi>perſiſt</hi> in this their <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> nor breed up their <hi>Children</hi> in it, nor ſo zealouſly endeavour to inſtil the ſame <hi>Prejudices</hi> and <hi>Miſtakes</hi> into all with whom they converſe. But the Truth is, they ordinarily look upon their <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>Orders</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> as the Effect of an <hi>higher Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, greater Knowledge</hi> than other Men have attain'd to.— They rather count us <hi>Church-men</hi> the <hi>weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> if they will allow us <hi>ſo much:</hi> For, otherwiſe, if they do not take us for the <hi>weaker</hi> and <hi>worſe Chriſtians,</hi> why do they <hi>ſeparate</hi> from us? Why do they <hi>aſſociate</hi> and <hi>combine</hi> in <hi>diſtinct Congregations,</hi> as being <hi>purer,</hi> more <hi>ſelect Chriſtians,</hi> than others? Now, tho' ſuch Perſons as theſe, may be in truth <hi>very weak,</hi> of <hi>little Judgment</hi> or <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> notwithſtanding this <hi>Conceit</hi> of <hi>themſelves</hi> and <hi>their Party;</hi> yet are they not to claim the <hi>Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of <hi>weak Perſons,</hi> ſince they are fond of their <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> againſt all the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Conviction</hi> offer'd to them. They can juggle in the Caſe, be either <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>ſtrong,</hi> according as it beſt ſuits with the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> they are managing againſt us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next <hi>Argument</hi> is, about <hi>the Miſchiefs which the want of ſuch Union,</hi> as he would have, <hi>brings. The Publick is depriv'd of the Labours of many Learned and Godly Men.</hi> But he would have done well to have prov'd, That the Publick <hi>wanted</hi> the Labours of thoſe Perſons which he ſets off with ſuch a Character: And,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135650:9"/> if it does <hi>not,</hi> I cannot imagine why they ſhould be ſought after, ſince there are ſo many <hi>true Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> who deſerve to be provided for in the firſt place, as being ſuperiour to them in point of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and at leaſt equal in <hi>all other Reſpects.</hi> — He goes on, and tells us, <hi>That for want of this Union, one Side cries out PERSECUTORS! and Men of cruel and bitter Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits!</hi> But 'tis ſtrange to hear Men talk of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> when there is a <hi>Toleration;</hi> and complain of <hi>Hardſhips</hi> upon the Account of <hi>Religion,</hi> when they may do <hi>what they liſt.</hi> The <hi>Great Perſecution</hi> therefore muſt be <hi>Want of Preferment:</hi> For, tho' the <hi>Church</hi> may be never ſo blame-worthy upon the Account of her <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> there is no Fault to be found with her <hi>Revenues;</hi> which if they could enjoy, it is not unlikely but they would be able to ſatisfie themſelves pretty well with being within <hi>the Pale of the Church.</hi> But it ſeems, it is a grievous Crime, <hi>That theſe Choice Men have not Choice Livings;</hi> and <hi>our Clergie</hi> are <hi>doubly faulty,</hi> Firſt, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Benefic'd Hirelings themſelves;</hi> and next, in not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, that theſe <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Godly Men,</hi> whoſe <hi>Labours</hi> are ſo much <hi>wanted,</hi> be not made <hi>Hirelings</hi> too.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His <hi>laſt Argument</hi> for <hi>Union,</hi> is, to conſider the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Things</hi> which are and have been in <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: That they are not Things of abſolute Neceſſity to Salvation.</hi> Here our <hi>Author</hi> ſeems to me to write Booty, and to plead <hi>againſt</hi> thoſe, whoſe Cauſe he meant to <hi>defend</hi> (as before hinted.) For, if the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Controverſie be not <hi>Sinful,</hi> but of an <hi>Indifferent Nature;</hi> then I would fain know, why our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſhould refuſe their <hi>Obedience?</hi> For, if there muſt be ſome <hi>Rules</hi> appointed for the <hi>Manner</hi> of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135650:9"/> 
               <hi>God,</hi> and for the Maintenance of <hi>good Diſcipline,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of Making theſe <hi>Rules</hi> muſt rather lie in them that have the <hi>Government</hi> over us, than in thoſe, whom none beſides themſelves, think to be ſufficiently quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the Exerciſe of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it ſhall be here urg'd, That tho' the Things to which <hi>Conformity</hi> is requir'd, be not in themſelves <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> yet they are ſo <hi>to them,</hi> and therefore they muſt not do them, for fear, or rather becauſe they know they ſhall offend their <hi>Conſciences.</hi> In anſwer to this, I ſay, That by <hi>this Rule,</hi> the <hi>Superiors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> can have <hi>no manner</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> of what kind ſoever. For, if they command any thing contrary to <hi>Gods Laws,</hi> it is <hi>ipſo facto Null;</hi> and if they command any thing which God had <hi>before enjoin'd,</hi> This owes not its Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to <hi>Humane Authority,</hi> but <hi>Divine.</hi> It remains therefore, that either the <hi>Church</hi> hath <hi>no Power at all,</hi> or elſe She can exerciſe it only about ſuch Things as do not concern <hi>the Foundations of Faith or Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
